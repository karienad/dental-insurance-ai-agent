## 🧠 What I Built

This project automates the time-consuming and error-prone process of dental insurance verification using AI. It integrates real-time voice processing, natural language understanding, and data verification into a single intelligent assistant that reduces the average verification time from **14 minutes to real-time**.

I customized this solution to address real-world pain points in dental clinics — especially around increasing **claim denials due to registration and eligibility errors**.

## 🎯 Key Features

- ✅ Real-time voice-based insurance eligibility checks
- ✅ Handles diverse accents using FAISS-based correction
- ✅ Extracts and verifies key insurance data from conversations
- ✅ Automates benefit validation, prior authorizations, and eligibility confirmation
- ✅ Reduces daily manual work by 4–6 hours per clinic

## 🏥 Why This Matters

> 📈 70% of providers face rising denials  
> ⏳ 14 minutes is the average time for manual verification  
> 💸 Each resubmission can cost $25–$118  
> 🧾 65% of denied claims are never resubmitted

This AI Agent helps reduce denials, save operational costs, and improve staff productivity through 24/7 voice-based automation.
