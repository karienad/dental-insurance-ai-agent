    "I am going to use `gemini-1.5-flash-8b` using google api key. One of the best features of Google's Gemini API is its intuitive chat handling. Unlike other LLM APIs, you don't need to specify roles like \"user\" or \"assistant\" - Gemini handles this automatically. Other APIs, such as OpenAI, often require something like:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "messages = [\n",
    "    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant\"},\n",
    "    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello\"},\n",
    "    {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Hi there!\"},\n",
    "    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"How are you?\"}\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also utilize the libraries like `gpt4all`  to load LLM modules via the Python SDK and API (without downloading locally, though local usage is supported).\n",

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.

    "1. **Text Embedding**: Text is converted into numerical vectors using HuggingFace embeddings.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Setup and Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prepare the Environment:**\n",
    "   - Load necessary libraries for environment management, data handling, and API interactions.\n",
    "   - Set up environment variables and configure the Generative Model using an API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialize the Class:**\n",
    "   - Define a class named `InsuranceVerifier` to handle insurance verification tasks.\n",
    "   - Set up the system prompts to guide the AI assistant's role and interactions.\n",

    "Each function is designed to extract specific information from text using prompts sent to the LLM:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Extract Insurance Status:**\n",
    "   - This function identifies whether the patient’s insurance status is active or inactive.\n",
    "   - The model processes the text and returns \"Active,\" \"Inactive,\" or \"None\" if unclear.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Extract Dates:**\n",
    "   - This function extracts dates from text and converts them into a standard format (MM/DD/YYYY).\n",
    "   - It validates the extracted date to ensure it is correctly formatted.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Extract Monetary Amounts:**\n",
    "   - This function identifies dollar amounts mentioned in the text.\n",
    "   - It returns the amount as a numeric value or \"None\" if no amount is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Extract Percentages:**\n",
    "   - This function extracts percentage values from the text.\n",
    "   - It ensures the extracted value is within a valid range (0-100).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Extract Plan Types:**\n",
    "   - This function identifies the type of insurance plan (e.g., PPO, HMO) from the text.\n",
    "   - It returns the plan type or \"None\" if the type is unclear.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Extract Group Numbers:**\n",
    "   - This function extracts the insurance group number from the text.\n",
    "   - It returns the group number or \"None\" if not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Extract Time Periods:**\n",
    "   - This function identifies time periods such as benefit periods or waiting periods from the text.\n",
    "   - It returns the period in a common format (e.g., \"Calendar Year,\" \"6 months\").\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Extract Frequency Limitations:**\n",
    "   - This function extracts frequency limitations, such as how often a benefit can be used.\n",
    "   - It returns the frequency or \"None\" if not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Extract Boolean Values:**\n",
    "   - This function identifies yes/no or required/not required answers from the text.\n",
    "   - It returns `True`, `False`, or \"None\" if unclear.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create an Instance:**\n",
    "   - Instantiate the `InsuranceVerifier` class with the relevant office name.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use Extraction Functions:**\n",
    "   - Apply the extraction functions to process text and retrieve information.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Handle Extracted Information:**\n",
    "   - Display or handle the extracted information as needed for verification purposes.\n",

    "# How the Dental AI Agent Code Pieces Come Together\n",
    "\n",
    "This document explains how various code components work together in the dental AI agent to verify insurance information efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main function coordinates all parts of the system to simulate a conversation with a patient for insurance verification. It uses natural language processing, speech recognition, and text-to-speech technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Libraries and Utilities:**\n",
    "   - Libraries for environment management (`os`, `warnings`), data handling (`json`, `numpy`), and time management (`time`).\n",
    "   - Utilities from custom modules to handle patient data, speech formatting, verification, and correction.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loading Models and Initializing Systems:**\n",
    "   - **Speech Recognition:** Uses the `speech_recognition` library to capture and process spoken input.\n",
    "   - **Whisper Model:** A pre-trained model used for transcribing speech to text.\n",
    "   - **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Converts text responses back into speech.\n",
    "   - **Correction System:** Uses FAISS to enhance accent handling and verify spoken input.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Initializing the AI Assistant:**\n",
    "   - **Patient Information:** A simulated patient is generated for the demonstration.\n",
    "   - **Insurance Verification:** The system initializes to handle verification tasks for the dental office.\n",
    "   - **Conversation Flow Manager:** Manages the conversation flow, ensuring the dialogue stays on track and transitions smoothly between phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Greeting:**\n",
    "   - The assistant starts with a professional greeting, introducing the dental office and asking for help with insurance verification.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Main Conversation Loop:**\n",
    "   - **Listening for Speech:** The system listens for spoken input using the microphone.\n",
    "   - **Processing Speech:** Converts spoken input into text and checks if the text needs correction based on context.\n",
    "   - **Handling Corrections:** If the input needs correction, the system enhances accent handling and may seek confirmation from the user.\n",
    "   - **Responding:** The system processes the input and generates an appropriate response, which is then converted back to speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Verification Completion:**\n",
    "   - The system checks if all required verification information has been collected.\n",
    "   - Displays and saves a summary of the verification results.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Error Handling:**\n",
    "   - The system handles common errors, such as misunderstood input, and requests the user to repeat or rephrase.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The dental AI agent combines multiple technologies to create an efficient system for insurance verification. It leverages natural language processing to understand and respond to user input, ensuring accurate and professional interactions in a dental office setting.\n"

    "Here, we outline the steps to separate the code into independent components and compile them together as `main.py`. Follow these instructions to run the script using `python main.py` from your terminal. I have put the debugging prints as it is for alpha testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create Independent Components:**\n",
    "   - Separate your functionalities into different modules (e.g., `utils.py`, `llm.py`, `stt.py`, `tts.py`, `verification.py`, `flow.py`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Combine Components in `main.py`:**\n",
    "   - Import the necessary modules and libraries in `main.py`.\n",
    "   - Integrate the functionalities in the `main()` function to manage the overall workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Setting Up the Virtual Environment:**\n",
    "   - If you are downloading this from GitHub, please activate the virtual environment first depending on your system.\n",
